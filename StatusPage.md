# The Status of the project at certain steps/dates #

## 15.Nov.2010 ##
I have finished implementing DAO logic that contains CRUD methods.

What to do next? - I need an User Interface to access the DAO.
If I write some JSPs can I call DAO straight from JSPs?

Razvan 11.05.2013: DAO it is not finished because the UnitTests are not passing! TODO: you must have UnitTest that actually pass.

Razvan 04.Aprilie.2014: am vorbit cu Dan Ratoiu si trebuie sa folosesc cumva un MVC Framework pt web aplications.
