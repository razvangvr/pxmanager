        <h1>JavaScript Objects</h1>
        "Everything" in JavaScript is an Object.
        In addition, JavaScript allows you to define your own objects.
        <h2>Everything is an Object</h2>
        <div>
            In JavaScript almost everything is an object. Even primitive datatypes (except null and undefined) can be treated as objects.
            <ul>
                <li>Booleans can be objects or primitive data treated as objects</li>
                <li>Numbers can be objects or primitive data treated as objects</li>
                <li>Strings are also objects or primitive data treated as objects</li>
                <li>Dates are always objects</li>
                <li>Maths and Regular Expressions are always objects</li>
                <li>Arrays are always objects</li>
                <li>Even functions are always objects</li>
            </ul>
        </div>
        <h3>Creating JavaScript Objects</h3>
        With JavaScript you can define and create your own objects.<br>
        There are 2 different ways to create a new object:
        <ul>
            <li> Define and create a direct instance of an object.</li>
            <li>Use a function to define an object, then create new object instances.</li>
        </ul>
        <div>
            <h4>Creating a Direct Instance</h4>
            <script>
                var person = new Object();
                person.firstname = "John";
                person.lastname = "Doe";
                person.age = 50;
                person.eyecolor = "blue";
                document.write(person.firstname + " is " + person.age + " years old.");

                dylan = {
                    firstname: "Dylan",
                    lastname: "Bruck",
                    age: 20,
                    eyecolor: "blue",
                    nameToUpperCase: function(){//am definit o proprietate care e o functie
                    	this.firstname.toUpperCase();                    	
                    }
                }
                document.write(" FirstName:"+dylan.firstname + " is " + dylan.age + " years old.");
                dylan.nameToUpperCase();
                document.write(" FirstName:"+dylan.firstname);
            </script>
        </div>
        <div>
            <h4>Using an Object Constructor</h4>
            The following example uses a function to construct the object:
            <script>
                function persoana(firstname, lastname, age, eyecolor)
                {
                    this.firstname = firstname;
                    this.lastname = lastname;
                    this.age = age;
                    this.eyecolor = eyecolor;
                    /*
                     * The reason for all the "this" stuff is that you're going to have more than one person at a time (which person you're dealing with must be clear). 
                     * That's what "this" is: the instance of the object at hand. 
                     */
                }
                myFather = new persoana("John", "Doe", 50, "blue");
                document.write(myFather.firstname + " is " + myFather.age + " years old.");
            </script> 
            <h5>Creating JavaScript Object Instances</h5>
            Once you have a object constructor, you can create new instances of the object, like this:
            <script>
                var myFather = new persoana("Vasile", "Gaston", 62, "green");
                var myMother = new persoana("Sally", "Rally", 48, "green");
            </script>
            <h5>Adding Properties to JavaScript Objects</h5>
            You can add new properties to an existing object by simply giving it a value.
            Assume that the person object already exists - you can then give it new properties:
            <script>
                person.nationality = "English";
                x = person.nationality;
                document.write("person nationality:"+x);
            </script>
        </div>
    </body>
