	<h2>JavaScript Objects</h2>
	<p>An object is delimited by curly braces. Inside the braces the
		object's properties are defined as name and value pairs (name :
		value). The properties are separated by commas:</p>

	<script>
		var person = {
			firstname : "John",
			lastname : "Doe",
			id : 5566
		}

		name = person.lastname;
		name = person["lastname"];
		document.write(name + "<br>");
	</script>
