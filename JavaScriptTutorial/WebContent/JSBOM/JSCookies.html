        <h2>What are Cookies?</h2>
        <p>Cookies are data, stored in small text files, on your computer.</p>
        When a web server has sent a web page to a browser, the connection is shut down, and the server forgets everything about the user.
        Cookies were invented to solve the problem "how to remember information about the user":
        <ul>
            <li>When a user visits a web page, his name can be stored in a cookie.</li>
            <li>Next time the user visits the page, the cookie "remembers" his name.</li>
        </ul>
        When a browser request a web page from a server, cookies belonging to the page is added to the request. This way the server gets the necessary data to "remember" information about users
